# Team Contest Reference (TCR) for competitive programming
25 page document containing algorithms and data structures useful for competitive programming (mostly in C++). Builds upon previous templates, also not all code was written by me (references are usually given within the document).

Compile with `lualatex --shell-escape tcr_main.tex`.
